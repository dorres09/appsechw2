Encrypted database models
	By using django-cryptography, database fields are encrypted with API method. In models.py, the following fields are encrypted: product_name, product_image_path, recommended_price, description, amount, and fp. For example, product_name = models.CharField(max_length=50, unique=True) is replaced with product_name = encrypt(models.CharField(max_length=50, unique=True)).
	
Proper key management
	By using django-environ, key is stored in the memory and is loaded as an environment variable for security. It should keep the key externally and flexible for admin. 
	In settings.py, import environ is added to use django-environ. 
	env = environ.Env() is added for initialization. 
	envirion.Env.read_env() is added for reading the .env file. 
	SECRET_KEY = env("SECRET KEY") is added to read the key.
